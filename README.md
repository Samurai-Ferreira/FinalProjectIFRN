# FinalProjectIFRN
Final Project to my technician degree in mechatronics.


Final project submitted to the Integrated Technical Course in Mechatronics of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Norte as a partial academic requirement for obtaining the diploma of Technician in Mechatronics. 

Academic advisor: Prof. Dr. Gustavo Fontoura de Souza

This final project report will detail the specifications of the satellite-assisted explorer 
robot prototype and its simulation. The project's development aims to merge algorith
mic concepts of pathfinding (A* Algorithm), strategies for the analysis and processing 
of geographic images (Python + A*), and methodologies for robotic control through the 
interpretation of environmental data (Python + Arduino). The goal is to produce sys
tems that captivate with their grandeur, utilizing this fusion of technologies—examples 
being Rovers, traffic applications like Waze, and military drones—bringing these tech
nologies closer to the reality of the general public. This transformation turns what was 
once imaginatively impressive into something achievable and feasible.In the execution 
of the project, programming concepts, microcontrollers, analytical geometry, and tech
nical drawing learned throughout the 4 years of the Mechatronics course were vital for 
achieving the proposed objectives.
